    <p> The Super Jazz Festival celebrates the Afro Brazilian music and, well, jazz. Different bands, DJs, 
        and singers ranging from big names to indie beginners unite together for this project to come to life in 
        the grassy outdoor spaces of CCBB Brasília. It's a good opportunity to relax, take the edge off and 
        enjoy the view of the dusk. The event is relatively short, starting at 5PM and ending at around 9H45PM. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 21px"> <strong> Hiromi Nagakura in Amazônia, with Ailton Krenak (11/06/24 — 18/08/24) </p> </strong>
    <p> This exhibit displays 120 photographs of the renowed japanese photographer Hiromi Nakagura, taken in trips 
        with Ailton Krenak. The trips took place mainly in Amazonian territory, between 1993 and 1998. The exhibit 
        allows the viewers to interact with objects taken from the villages and also offers a great deal of measures 
        of accessibility, such as audiodescriptions, tactile boards and videolibras. According to Krenak: "the moments 
        of intimacy and content between eternal friends are what inspired this photographical showing, mediated by
        the meetings with lovely people that welcomed us in their kitchens and canoes, their beaches of laughter and, 
        finally, into their villages: Ashaninka, Xavante, Krikati, Gavião, Yawanawá, Huni Kuin and other communities
        near the River of Juruá and surrounding the Lavrado region in Roraima". Certainly an interesting exhibit for 
        those who take an interest to the northern culture of Brasil, especially the indigenous ones.
